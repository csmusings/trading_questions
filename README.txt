The build executables just run make from command line. Quesiton1 uses dynamic programming table, question2 uses a mathematical simulation on multiple threads.
Although my code for question3 compiles and runs, it does not terminate and produce answer. I was not sure about this problem and attempted to use the Hungarian algorithms described on https://www.topcoder.com/community/competitive-programming/tutorials/assignment-problem-and-hungarian-algorithm/. 
question1 expected answer and runtime:  120536 ways and 33 microseconds to execute
question2 expected answer and runtime: 82.2% and 2.9 microseconds to execute
question3: compiles but does not terminate
